                                        <p>After completing my bootcamp I struggled to keep track of things to work on and staying organized. Tools like <a href="https://www.notion.so/help/guides/what-is-notion">Notion</a> and <a href="https://trello.com/tour">Trello</a> felt like overkill for my small personal projects.</p>
                                        <p>Then it hit me, why not take my bare-bones todo app from dev tutorial work and iterate on it? That way I could build my own features and functionality for fun while getting use out of them. I also realized that with some work it could actually be a helpful tool, and a good sandbox to hack on ideas that come to mind and learn more React.</p> 
                                        <p>Feel free to log in and use it for basic tasks. The fried chicken theme is just based on the fact I used a random name generator for the repo, which was "crispy-octo," so I just ran with the crispy concept.</p>

                                        <p>My friend Gio, who is an avid basketball player and content creator, approached me with the idea of We Got Next and the ideas started flowing.</p>
                                        <p>What if there was an easy way to find a basketball court where people are playing? What if someone could check out information on local courts and connect with players in their area?</p>
                                        <p>All we had was a giant spreadsheet of information about basketball courts. This is the project that inspired me to get stronger at coding and build my friend's dream into a reality. I've had a lot of fun getting this far and I'm excited for the possibilities of what's to come.</p> 
                                        <p>Ask me about the mobile app -- the desktop app shares all of the same functionality, but we feel this one will eventually be mobile-first.</p>

In the future I'd like to get involved with some <a href="https://threejs.org/">Three JS</a> which is inspiring technology, and other comparable visual libraries.</p>
