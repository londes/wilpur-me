                        <p>My name is Will Purcell and I am a customer-facing engineer with particular interest in JavaScript and Front-End. It's fun and rewarding to make things people can interact with on the internet.</p>
                        <p>I currently spend my time as a Customer AI Architect at <a href="https://writer.com">Writer</a>. I also enjoy riding my bicycle, music, food, beer, games, reading, and snowboarding.</p>
                        <p>Professionally <a href="./hosted/william_purcell_resume.pdf">my background</a> is primarily in Solutions and Sales Engineering but I've always found coding to be a fun and interesting problem solving exercise.  In all of my past roles I've found ways to hack on new technology and build with code to help my team. Right now I'm focused on diving into Python as it's prominent in our AI product code base.</p>  
                        <p>I'm having a lot of fun building things, please feel free to reach out for opportunities to code or work together.</p>
