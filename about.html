                        <p>My name is Will Purcell and I'm a Full-Stack engineer with further interest in Front-End.  It's fun and rewarding to make things people can interact with on the internet.</p>
                        <p>I currently spend most of my time studying JavaScript and Math. I also enjoy riding my bicycle, music, food, beer, reading, and snowboarding.</p>
                        <p>Professionally <a href="./hosted/william_purcell_resume.pdf">my background</a> is primarily in Solutions and Sales Engineering but I've always found coding to be a fun and interesting problem solving exercise.  In all of my past roles I've found ways to hack on new technology and build with code to help my team.</p>  
                        <p>I'm looking to bring my interest in coding full-time. I'm having so much fun building things and I think I'm addicted to learning. Please feel free to reach out for opportunities to code or work together.</p>
